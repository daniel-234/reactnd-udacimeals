# UdaciMeals

In class project built by the React Training and Udacity team members for the course React and Redux as part of the `React Nanodegree` program.
Worked on it by following the teacher's step by step coding.

## Getting started

To launch the application, (clone this repo and) download it locally, then install it with the command ```npm install``` and launch it with ```npm launch```.
The Front-End server on your local machine should be accessible on *localhost: 3000*.

## Edamam API Keys

To see items displayed when you search meals or in the Shopping List window, you'll need to register with Edamam to get an API key for searching recipes.
This is free and it is not a long process.
If you want to do it, you can head to [Edamam website - Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api).

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Information about the code

The code for this project was copied from the in class project as part of the React Nanodegree developed by Udacity to teach students Redux by building a React and Redux app from scratch.
I just replicated the teachers work step by step while following the class.
